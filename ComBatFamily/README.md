# ComBat Family of Harmonization Methods

**Maintainer**: Andrew Chen, andrewac@pennmedicine.upenn.edu

**License**: Artistic License 2.0

The ComBat Family extends the original ComBat methodology to enable flexible covariate modeling, leveraging efficient R implementations of regression models. A method that belongs in the ComBat Family satisfies the following conditions:

- Modeling of covariate effects in location and scale
- Batch effects in location and scale of measurements
- Empirical Bayes step for borrowing information across features

ComBat Family methods include:

1. ComBat (Johnson et al., 2007)
2. ComBat-GAM (Pomponio et al., 2020)
3. Longitudinal ComBat (Beer et al., 2020)
4. Robust ComBat (Work-in-progress)
5. ComBat-GAMLSS (Experimental)

This package also includes the CovBat Family, which likewise extends the original CovBat methodology to enable flexible covariate modeling while removing batch effects in the mean and covariance of measurements.

**NOTE:** This package is still a work-in-progress and will be updated soon to include the following features:

- Nonparametric Empirical Bayes step
- Empirical Bayes step leveraging non-Gaussian data distributions
- Functions for evaluating batch effects before and after harmonization

## 1. Installation
The R package can be installed via devtools by running the following code

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("andy1764/ComBatFamily", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Then, you can load this package via

```
library(ComBatFamily)
```

## 2. Usage
Vignettes are provided for both the ComBat family `comfam` and the CovBat family `covfam` which can be accessed via

```
vignette("comfam")
vignette("covfam")
```

Example ComBat Family calls for `iris` data, treating `Species` as batch:

```
# Original ComBat
comfam(iris[,1:2], iris$Species, covar = iris[3:4], lm, y ~ Petal.Length + Petal.Width)

# ComBat-GAM
comfam(iris[,1:2], iris$Species, covar = iris[3:4], gam, y ~ s(Petal.Length) + Petal.Width)
```

Note that non-Gaussian data distributions are supported by functions such as `glm` and `gamlss`; however, the batch effect correction may produce harmonized data outside the original range of values. For now, specification of non-Gaussian distributions will generate a warning. This support is still a work-in-progress.
